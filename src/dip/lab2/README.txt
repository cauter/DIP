INSTRUCTIONS:
===================================
You have been presented with a description and purpose of the
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). You will need to understand this
principle to successfully complete the lab work.

DIP RULES:
    A. HIGH LEVEL MODULES SHOULD NOT DEPEND UPON LOW
       LEVEL MODULES. BOTH SHOULD DEPEND UPON ABSTRACTIONS.

    B. ABSTRACTIONS SHOULD NOT DEPEND UPON DETAILS. DETAILS
       SHOULD DEPEND UPON ABSTRACTIONS.

DIP OBJECTIVES:
    1. Reduce rigidity and fragility.
    2. Improve portability (code reuse, flexibility)

THE CHALLENGE:
--------------
In this lab #2 your main goal is to provide a high-level class
that delegates all the work to the low-level classes via abstraction, as
described by the DIP. You will also need the abstraction layer. And you will
need to make some changes to the low-level classes.

Once you have done this you need to test your code in the startup class. Take
a look at the code in the instructor solution for lab #1 to get an idea of
how to do this.
